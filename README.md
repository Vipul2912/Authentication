## Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- Password Reset
- Protected Routes
- Error Handling and Notifications
- Responsive Design

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, React Router, Axios, React Hot Toast
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Other Tools:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- MongoDB installed or a MongoDB Atlas account for the database.
- Git installed for cloning the repository.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vipul2912/Authentication.git
cd Authentication
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the backend server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend development server.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build for Production

To create a production build of the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set for both the backend and frontend. For example, make sure the frontend is configured to use the correct backend URL.

## Usage

- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
- Register a new user or log in with an existing account.
- Test the password reset functionality by clicking "Forgot Password" on the login page.
